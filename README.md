# HID Payloads for P4wnP1 and General HID Attacks

## Introduction
This is a collection of HID payloads that can be used on devices like [P4wnP1](https://github.com/mame82/P4wnP1) or other HID attack tools. HID (Human Interface Device) payloads allow you to simulate keyboard inputs and mouse movements on a target computer to execute certain actions. These payloads can be used for testing system security, demonstrating attack techniques, or conducting penetration tests.

## Requirements
- P4wnP1 or another HID-capable device that can act as a USB HID device (e.g., USB Rubber Ducky, Digispark, Teensy)
- A host computer where the payload will be executed
- Optional: Knowledge of working with HID payloads and scripting languages like DuckyScript, Python, or others
